This is long overdue.

Over the last few decades staff and users of the ISIS neutron and muon facility have developed various codes and tools to enable them to do science. This has evolved over the years from files stored on somebody's personal machine to using version control systems hosted at ISIS to most recently making use of cloud hosted repositories.

Several years ago we started to encourage staff to use GitHub for their code. We've come a long way but we are not finished. Not everything used by our staff and users is hosted on our organisation's GitHub.

This is an attempt to help you find code-related stuff that you might not be able to find elsewhere.

I also have several other things I want to achieve with these GitHub Pages but you'll just have to watch this space because I don't want to over-promise and underdeliver!
